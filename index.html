            Some sites wear neckties; this one shows up in neon sneakers,
            half-finished prototypes tucked under its arm. It is a sandbox for
            wild web builds and off-beat data-science sketches, a playground
            where folklore trades campfire stories for JavaScript, CSS, and
            Quarto.

            Numbers here morph into playful visuals, and HTML stretches into
            unexpected shapes. One week you might find a data-driven journey
            through long-distance running, the next an interactive
            monster-sighting map or a retro-inspired game.
          </p>

          <p>
            Think of it as a garage after midnightâ€”lights on, coffee brewing,
            code flickering across screens. Wander in, tap a few buttons, and
            discover what has hatched today.
